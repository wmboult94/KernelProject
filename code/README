The code can be run by simply typing python front_kernel.py
However the code utilises a number of datasets obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository; links to the datasets are posted below.
Libras dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Libras+Movement
Synthetic control dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Synthetic+Control+Chart+Time+Series

To perform classification on the experimental datasets, place the front kernel code in a folder within a directory, and then place the dataset folders in the root of the directory, naming the folders libra_data, and synthcontrol, respectively.
